"R3RUBB6REUGTT","Binu","Before finalizing the AUE60 55"", I visited Croma and Vijay Sales to check for the same TV or similar models for their features and picture quality. I was told AUE60 & AUE70(the models listed here as Crystal 4K and 4K Pro) are E-commerce exclusive models, not available offline. I was shown AU7700 which has the same processor, panel and features, but was listed at 65K for the 55"" version. I liked the picture quality, and decided I'll get the AUE60 since it shares so much with AU7700, and save ~20k.Why I went for AUE60  vs. AUE70 - I knew I wouldn't be needing a voice assistant, and wanted to save 3k. I knew even if I wanted a voice assistant, I could plug in Fire TV/Mi TV box and get those features later on. Delivery was pretty hassle free, the delivery executive unloaded the TV in the room I asked for, and opened the box to inspect the TV for any physical damages. Samsung technicians came in a few hours later, installed and gave a demo.Sound:Per other reviews - sound from speakers is apparently bad, but in my case, I found it satisfactory. I have it wall mounted in a 10X12ft room, and the TV's speakers sound better compared to Bose Soundlink Speakers that I connected it to via Bluetooth.Picture:The Panel's great, but nothing worth raving about. Gray uniformity isn't great(i.e. gray tones won't be perfectly uniform across the whole panel, there'll be darker zones towards the edges/corners based on backlight placement). Blacks aren't perfectly black - and they're brighter than you'd expect from a VA panel, but this isn't noticeable at all when the room is lit. No backlight bleed. Colors are as good as I'd like them to be, and the panel does get noticeably bright for my taste, even when brightness is turned down to 40%. 720p content is watchable from >8ft, 1080p is good(I'd say better than I expected), and 4K is well, 4K.Connectivity:I have a 35 Mb/s broadband  connection and all content streams in 4K when available, without stutters. The TV has Bluetooth 5.0, and works with TWS and Neckband earphones fine(I use Oppo Enco W51 and Boat Rockerz 330) - there's no noticeable latency, and volume can be controlled through the remote itself.Apps & Features:Has all the standard slew of streaming apps I needed - Netflix, Hotstar, Prime, Apple TV+ & YouTube. All of them stream 4k content, except for Hotstar - which only streamed 4K a few times. 1080p is still very watchable, and not really a deal breaker. No Dolby Vision support - which I made my peace with considering the fact that 99% of budget TVs in the market can't produce the contrast you'd expect out of DV content anyways, so why care. You get HDR, and HDR content is definitely better looking than non-HDR ones in terms of colors and vibrancy. I planned to use the TV without cable, but the TV does come with some channels like Republic TV, Bloomberg, 9XM, etc., these stream in 1080p, so a great bonus to have.Remote:Very basic RF remote, unlike Bluetooth ones on most new TVs. The remote's looks pretty sleek and stylish, but that's about it. Biggest gripe - typing to search for things within apps is a pain in the behind, you'll need to use the D-pad to navigate on an on-screen keyboard. You can control the TV using Samsung's SmartThings App, but guess what - you can't even use your phone's keyboard to type in when controlling through the app - this is something that can be added through an update, but it's not there yet.Attached pictures are all of 4K content. Resolution might get scaled down after I submit the review, but you can still get an idea of the TV's design/looks, Panel colors and contrast, etc.I'd say I'm really happy - and given the chance, wouldn't change my decision. It's a Samsung TV, so end of the day, if it produces a decent picture, and lasts a couple of years more than I expect, I can overlook all other cons. I'd highly recommend the TV if you have the same expectations from your next TV.","Reviewed in India on 18 March 2022","Best(Branded) Budget TV",5,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51DoilNqdgL.jpg

Picture quality is good, As i have prime membership, my parents watch lots of movies on it.4. Sounds appear to be bit low sometimes in Hollywood movies. It can also be possible as english is not my first language, so i have to listen dialogues bit louder to understand.5. Easily connects with WIFI, Currently all digital channels which are available for free running via WIFI only.6. It also feels laggy sometimes. That is the only negative point I can say. Takes 2-3 secound times to run an application.7. At that price on which i have purchased it, it's a steal deal.

"RTUD24B3VS8D8","nkdev89","My honest review after using it for a week, I brought CUE60 65 inch model. The display is great . Although the wall mount did not come with the box , The service engineer brought along with him and installed it at free of cost.The tizen OS is bit slow and the TV with this price range could have better OS . May be this is entry level model it has less and slow features .Offcourse we need fire tv stick with 4k or some android tv box. I use imported Nvidia shield Tv which work well with this TV.Although nothing mentioned about Aiplay in the description and also in the samsung site. This TV has Airplay and Works well, I tried mirroring screen from my iPad, iPhone and Mac book works as expected . Screen extend will only work if you connect the MacBook charger .Speaker is worst, can’t expect more in 20W speaker should buy sound bars > 400WIf you just need a great display , screen mirroring . casting go for it . If you need more features with fast OS think about it what features you need before buying it.","Reviewed in India on 10 June 2023","Good Tv with great display and Airplay",4,"","38","Crystal 4K iSmart Series","65 inches"

"R2FMB2PXTOTRWE","chetan sharma"," Title: An Amazing 4K UHD TV with Easy InstallationRating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ (5/5)Review:I recently purchased the Samsung 4K UHD TV and I must say, it has been an absolute game-changer in terms of home entertainment. This television offers exceptional picture quality and brilliant color reproduction that truly elevates my viewing experience to a whole new level. The clarity and detail are outstanding, making everything I watch appear incredibly lifelike.One of the standout features of this TV is its affordable price tag. Samsung has truly outdone themselves by offering such a high-quality 4K UHD TV at a budget-friendly cost. It's incredible to see how technology has evolved, making premium features accessible to a wider audience.Furthermore, the installation process of this TV was a breeze. The included instructions were straightforward and easy to follow, allowing me to set it up within minutes. The TV also comes with a user-friendly interface and a handy remote control that makes navigating through various settings and features a seamless experience.Despite its impressive performance, I have come across a few minor cons that I believe are worth mentioning. Firstly, the audio quality could be better. While it is acceptable, I would have appreciated a more immersive sound experience. However, this can easily be resolved by connecting external speakers or a soundbar.Additionally, the TV's remote control could have been designed with more tactile buttons for easier navigation. Although the remote is functional and intuitive, some users may prefer a more traditional layout.In summary, the Samsung 4K UHD TV has exceeded my expectations in terms of its picture quality, affordable price, and ease of installation. The few minor downsides do not overshadow the overall positive experience with this product. If you are in the market for an incredible 4K UHD TV at an affordable price point, I highly recommend considering the Samsung 4K UHD TV. It delivers exceptional value and provides a truly immersive viewing experience.","Reviewed in India on 4 August 2023","Go for it",5,"","6","Crystal 4K Neo Series","43 inches"

Only issue is stand is very cheap quality plastic. Samsung could have given a metal stand in the middle but its a cheap plastic stand at the edges which makes it risky. May be its a technique to promote wall mounting because that requires additional installation cost.","Reviewed in India on 13 April 2023","Nice Big TV but …",4,"","12","Crystal 4K Neo Series","55 inches"
"RWLQQ8JNL0V0F","Anamika","It does the job. However, one strange feature is observed...I have a Cable connection so when I type 305 for Republic Bharat channel, strangely it lands on Channel 303 in the first try. So say when you try typing in 305  the second time, it would land correctly i.e., on 305. But always in the first instance when you open the TV for the day t would land on 303. Tried a couple of times...did that in full light slowly, normally, quickly. In all instances it lands on 303.Since it is doing its job hence Im continuing with it.","Reviewed in India on 8 June 2023","It is SAMSUNG!",3,"","2","Crystal 4K Neo Series","43 inches"
