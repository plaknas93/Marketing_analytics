R115T7BXN3Q0ZW,VINEET MISHRA,"I have stopped using my laptop. This has become my primary device. I do competitive programming and watch Ott for hours. It Looks very sexy, Battery is good but could have been better. MY ONLY COMPLAINT IS, that I have iphone 13 which has oled display, which lacks LTPO but I feel has better display. I have used samsung smartphone in past and have seen Samsung S series tablet, both of which had Super Amoled, they lacked LTPO but have had far superior display with constant 120 Hz. This is just a simple LED panel, which kind of makes me very SAD because of the amount I paid. Together with magic keyboard, it cost me more around 1.09 Lakh. With that being said, it has LED display, feels like I only paid for apple logo. So, I would advise people, if you can find go for m1 version pro or Air(which is better for 90% people out there), there is literally no difference in m1 and m2 in day to day usage. AND My advise to Apple, if they ever read this, if u are so much into charging for every single feature you offer, better, take away all the faltu gimmick like LTPO or even 120 Hz from display & please offer genuine features like OLED or at least mini-LED(but mini-LED will drain more power) with better battery in ipad pro 11‚Äù, i don‚Äôt want to buy 12.9 for mni-Led, because people buy tablets for portablity, 11‚Äô‚Äô inch is the right sweet spot size of pro tablets, just load it with every best feature for a tablet you got in your inventory, or soon you will loose the brand value you have earned over the years among your customers.",Reviewed in India on 23 November 2022,Except display quality for price Everything is brilliant,4,,128,,,

R2ZXU63BEAPZA1,Placeholder,"That's why it's said since Centuries  "" Speech is Silvern;! Silence is Golden"". I had no business in the first place to any Feedback whatsoever. Bitter Truth always hurts. Even you know this, so do I and so does the whole world. My Review contained Inappropriate Comments. I had primarily asked for a Refund so I could upgrade to the 12.1 Inch M2 iPad XDR PRO with XDR DISPLAY. At around 4 am that day, One of your very own Customer Care Executives who are Multi-faced and Multi-faceted, told me to wait 3 days for a decision on the Refund. I later discovered he had deliberately fooled me into raising my hopes for the Refund and then dashing them to the ground--tantalizing me, in other words. Perhaps, he didn't have the Courage to be Frank Enough and dismiss me abruptly as your other Customer Care Executive Smita did. Your Agreement with Apple should have been highlighted in the first place. But it was deliberately and carefully hidden. It surfaced only after Smita told me straight that your Tie-up with Apple rules out a Refund. Fine! No Problem! "" False, Misleading, Inauthentic Comments or Profane and Misleading "" is your Style of Business and Functioning.Not mine. I had been denied a Refund and immediately asked for Feedback.It was like rubbing salt in my wounds. I May not be as Qualified and Capable as you are to do Business,  but I can understand that if I had even the slightest hint that I wouldn't get a Refund at all, I would never have wasted my Time and Energy in giving you a Feedback or writing a Review. I don't know how you would have reacted if Customer Care Executives from the same Company tantalized you and then dismissed you like a Beggar under the pretext of Privacy Policy and some Unknown and Hidden Agreement of yours with Big Boss Apple!",Reviewed in India on 1 March 2023,"Buy the 12.1 Inch M2 iPad XDR PRO Display only, not it's small Brother.",1,,17,,,

RH7LAMJ9E8GIJ,Sambit Koley,"¬†My story is kind of amazing. I wanted to buy M1 one but couldn't find it anywhere except on Amazon. But recently when I try to buy that, it said ""Items couldn't be delivered to your location.""!!Tried for 2-3 days. Then I ordered the Ipad M2 on Amazon, but they never delivered it on time. Bad delivery experience.So I finally bought it on Apple Store. Smoothest experience plus an amazing free personalized engraving!This device is a beast. Welcome to a lag free life. I actually use this as a secondary device while I am working and it tackle everything you throw at it.Sound is the department where I am flabbergasted. What an amazing sound exp at the top 70-100% volume! Movies and shows are amazing.Security is also top notch. You can't install an app or use saved passwords without the faceid.Grand purchase.If you can get the M1 variant, you can save 10k. Otherwise, as I said, if you can find it.
