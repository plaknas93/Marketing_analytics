"R175IAF485LQY8","Sameer S.","It is a gift that I got for my mother and I am not an IOS user. Her primary use for it is family connection and browsing, so no high end use. However, the product does make a great gift and is one of the most affordable  models which is currently under production and therefore you can expect a support for next 3 years or so at the very least. I personally love the screen quality and touch sensitivity. The default settings are great. Import data from icloud backup was effortless. Default home screen layout is absolutely intuitive. Overall I am very happy with the product and is perfect set up at 64GB if you are not the heave end user. I opted for WiFi only as I do not expect to not have a mobile hotspot or WiFi home network and therefore SIM option is not really needed for me. However, that is a personal choice depending on whether the iPad is being used as a primary device for communication.","Reviewed in India on 7 August 2023","Great product and a good gift",5,"",1,,,,

I may buy third party pencil but not sure.My use case is reading comics primarily and for that its perfect, I just need to find a cover which doesnt make iPad heavier.

"R3FIAFP9JZ1E53","phuong","¬†I have purchased this order on January and I was hyped about the Apple devices there performance, design and software. After 5 days of waiting my order arrived I picked up my order with full of enthusiasm. And all of my happiness went to vain as the shipment box was not properly packed and inside of it there was so much dirt. But I only care about the Ipad which is in okay condition. I turn it on and do all the things which are required to do in the beginning Ipad work fine that day. Then after first day its showed it true color.On the second day it while surfing safari it stops working all together, screen was not responding only spotlight was showing and I was having literal emotion damage because I just got it tomorrow. How searched the quick fix for it and got it (ie force restart). But that problem keep appearing again and again.I decided to replace it. I contacted amazon for it they said you have to contact apple customer care first. I contact apple customer care they said pls first contatct amazon. In this thing they wasted my 5 days(as they also tried to fix by there so called online repair which obviously doesn't work). They reset the device 3 times and done complete update and reset one time. I asked apple customer care executive to replace the product just provide me the ticket number or whatever they said it is not our policy first we do all the necessary steps to repair it and then we will proceed forward since they never detected any hardware problems so they never give damn what there customer was saying and the amazon customer care executive was outstanding he said sir without bringing the ticket we can not help you even though i said every thing. After that update reset device properly fine for straight 1 month I ignored all the things about replacement and return and keep doing work with until one holycrap day ipad screen become unresponsive this time it was onenote. Note: I forget to mention unresponsiveness happen almost with every app which consume internet and I do have a proper wifi connection.Thus again contacted and finally apple customer care executive said you have to come to the service center i asked him to give me the address he asked the pin code of my home town i said and with a smirk on face he said sir you have to go Bhopal as there is no service center are there in you town, my reaction was like a o acha, for this apple crap I have to go 750km away while and leave my exam all together.He said I can understand what you are going through and so on and on. But at the end he reset the device and the problem was still there than they again update reset as I said I will go into the future but now i just need quick fix he said fine now my device working and I am expecting nothing out of it as I know this wonderful piece of apple crap will so its true color soon or later I will provide future update on this product if this review do not get deleted by wonderful seller.

"RP2UY5ACF7FPA","Sriram V.","For people who are casual users and consume mainly content like Hotstar, Netflix etc. with a little productive work like word,excel - my advice is simple, close your eyes and go for this tablet . You will not regret it !!For the price of around 28K there is not a single android tablet that can deliver the performance and overall excellent user experience that the IPad does.I come from the world of android - tv, mobile etc.. everything for more than a decade using android. I never used to understand what the fuss was all about Apple and it‚Äôs expensive walled garden ecosystem.Then I got a iPhone 13 and IPad. Initial days was a challenge but later simply fell in love with the entire usage experience of the ios. Everything simply works well, you don‚Äôt have to tinker or customise hundred different things. They just work and work very well! Honestly I don‚Äôt really care about customising everything including the o/s in android, never had the time or interest. I don‚Äôt want to waste time doing things in 10 ways.That‚Äôs is where ios excels. Also I have both the oneplus 7 and Samsung tabs. Never was the toggling, browsing or general icon animation this smooth like in IOS. The android tabs are the worst , within a few months irrespective of the ram, chipset etc they start lagging, choppy feel to UI .iPad is just a class apart in how the UI is experienced. Does not matter about refresh rates , RAM , snapdragon blah blah. That‚Äôs the best thing about the IPad , you don‚Äôt have to worry about the insides or tech specs other than memory, the thing just works and handles anything you throw at it. That is where the real specialty of the closed garden approach of Apple really helps.You don‚Äôt have a hundred different companies tinkering and doing hundred different software or hardware combos.Last but not the least, the battery is a beast! Daily 6 hours of screen on time and I have to charge only on the third day for the IPad.Also the display somehow looks and feels better than any android pad. That 264 poi comes into play.","Reviewed in India on 11 April 2022","THE best tablet in this price range!",5,"","2",,,,

"R459MDUY1PM2V","Arjun","I basically bought this one for productivity purposes. Not used for gaming at all. Used for occassional content streaming.Rock solid build quality. Completely made of metal (Aluminium). Fit and finish is top notch as expected from Apple.In the productivity aspects like reading, writing (with the apple pencil), note making, this is truly a gem of a product. Nothing from the Android range will beat this iPad in this price range for sure. Extremely smooth performance in every aspect. No lagging whatsoever when using for multitasking. Great optimization. Excellent display too, easy on the eyes. If you are considering the device for getting important works done, look no further. Go for this one, eyes closed.This product is not made for content consumption. The aspect ratio of the screen is the biggest evidence for this. On streaming content, you get big black bars on the up and down sides of the screen. If you are looking for a tablet exclusively for watching movies, look towards the Samsung Galaxy series.It's a value for money product for sure. Completely satisfied with the performance.","Reviewed in India on 24 December 2022","The best tablet option available under 30,000 without any doubt.",5,"","15","Silver","64GB","WiFi","iPad"

"R3FMHWGLI2NF3V","Shivam Srivastava","For a couple of months I was damn skeptical about this iPad, I had mental fight whether I should go for iPad mini 6 or iPad 9th generation. And I wanted to buy higher storage variant but somehow I have to settle with 64gb variant and eventually bought this iPad 9th generation 64gb variant.Some of cons and pros are mentioned below-Pros-1. It's a beast when it comes to performance because of the powerful A13 bionic processor and no android tab can come near to this even below 50-60k.2. It has a great battery which lasts 1.5 days.3. This iPad is supported apple pencil 1st gen and the combination is buttery smooth.4. It also has 3.5 mm jack which no tab offers at this price category.5. A great 10.2 inch display which is very comfortable to hold and the screen size is just perfect.6. It has a crisp and clean speaker.7. It has a solid aluminium build and feels premium to hold.Cons-1. A biggest cons is lightening connector which is not as fast as type c.2. Display is non laminated but it's hard to notice with eyes.3. Speaker placement could have been better as it's only one-sided though it's a stereo speaker and your experience could be better by putting headphones.Conclusion: This is the best iPad at this price category. Go for it without any second thought. Samsung is lagging in so many things such as performance and display because they always offers TFT display which is worst at this price range. Apple always impressed us with their devices.","Reviewed in India on 27 January 2022","Best iPad| value for money",4,"https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/814e5uU7AAL.jpg

So content of Netflix runs at HD only and doesn‚Äôt go beyond that.
