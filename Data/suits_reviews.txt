Suits is one of those shows where once you start watching it you can't stop. It's addicting! The chemistry between the characters on this show is as good as it gets on tv! There are a thousand shows about lawyers out there but this is BY FAR the best and the most original one! I can not recommend this show enough!

SUITS is smart, sassy, clever, sophisticated, timely and immensely entertaining! The new series debuted with a full 60 minute story that establishes the characters very solidly, opens pathways for many story lines, and boasts an exceptional cast of fine actors. Here is hoping it makes it as an ongoing series, especially since it is not yet another crime drama! Not that Criminal Mains, The Mentalist, Without A Trace will lose their place among the best show on television, but with all the spinoffs on the crime shows, the available choices have been dwindling lately. SUITS is a lawyer show. Set in New York (captured, by the way, in beautiful cinematic vistas) it focuses on a very successful law firm, managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres) who balances the talents of her two top lawyers, the smarmy Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) who is a control freak, and the very brilliant but egotistical Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht). There is a particularly appealing and very bright secretary Donna (Sarah Rafferty) and a beautiful paralegal Rachel (Meghan Markel) and last but certainly not least by any means there is Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) - a young lad who is extremely bright, has a photographic memory, dropped out of college because he took tests for fellow students and got caught, fell into marketing drugs by default for need of money so that he could pursue his dream of being a lawyer, and falls quite by accident into the role of being selected as associate to the brilliant but self absorbed Harvey Spector. This is the team of characters who are destined to provide fascinating substories as they interact. The dialogue (Aaron Korsh and Sean Jablonski) is clever, bright, snappy, unclichéd, witty, and helps define the complexities of the characters. The pacing is exceptional (directors Kevin Bray and John Scott) and the series has the appearance of a high-end movie - excellent cinematography, expansive development of story in well-selected locations - but most of all this is a cast that is worthy of attention every moment they are on camera. It will be interesting to watch how Patrick J. Adams and Gabriel Macht grow into our psyches: both are exceptionally fine and provide a spectrum of the lawyer personality we haven't seen on a series before. This should be a major hit!

I don't even know how to describe how much I loved Suits. It's absolutely my favorite lawyer show of all-time. Even though it probably ran a season too long it went out with a string ending.! All you have to do is read through the reviews to see how loved this show really is. The writing and acting is what makes this show so special. The entire cast...Gabriel Macht (Harvey), Patrick J Adams (Mike), Meghan Markle (Rachel), Sarah Rafferty (Donna) and Rick Hoffman (Louis Litt), etc) are all perfect! I can not recommend this show enough. If you're a fan of lawyer type shows then watch this as soon as possible because this is the best of them!

I am writing this review while the series is on its fourth season, so I will try to avoid very specific spoilers for those who are about to giving it a chance. Even so, I have to refer to the development of plot lines, so if you are a beginner, perhaps it is better to stop reading. Suits' Pilot was frankly very engaging and interesting in terms of characters and situations, bringing a new turn on "another lawyers' series". I loved it instantly. It was frivolous but witty and sassy, the dynamics between Mike and Harvey was magnetic, the production was elegant, and the constant threat of revealing a serious secret was a compelling argument to keep watching a show. It also had humor and certain characters (like Donna or Louis) added enriching details. The series had a bright first season, in which Mike's ordeals and his master-disciple relationship with Harvey were at the center of the plot, and Mike's exceptional gift with memory played a fundamental part in the development of the plot line, justifying why the cheating was sustainable and why he could actually be an asset at the lawyers firm. Suits maintained interest and quality in the second season, with other characters gradually becoming stronger and widening the plot. But starting from the third season I started to observe a gradual decline in the plot line, and the exhaustion became conspicuous in the present, fourth season, the weakest of all so far, to the point that is has now, really, become "yet another lawyers' show". Mike's exceptional abilities have completely disappeared from the action in seasons three and four, and now he has become a bland character with nothing standing him above any other ambitious young executive. Jessica's new romantic interest is utterly unbelievable and it has negatively weighed in the show. Louis has been portrayed as a clown in seasons 3 and 4, and instead of being funny, he has become anti-climactic and unbelievable. Donna's place as Harvey's "counsellor" has been overextended and her "knowing things in advance" is, in my opinion, overused as a cliche. In short, the series had something different at the start, and it has veered into the road of losing its original allure and interest in a very noticeable way. PD: Jessica's amazing wardrobe, though, is always a pleasure to appreciate. And yes, as others have remarked, all the female characters seem to be cut with a same stereotyped template.
Patrick J. Adams & Gabriel Macht both give convincing performances in the pilot, something sure to excel even more throughout the series. The script, acting, and quality are all flawless, as far as television goes. If you're looking to be highly entertained on Thursday night, then look no further. The subtle humor, creative plot, and enjoyable dialogue entices the viewer more with each passing moment. If you're into legal shows that include all aspects of human nature, including compassion, then Suits is for you. Hopefully this show continues to have the opportunity to thrive; it has definitely drawn me in and I won't miss a second of it.
Just what I was looking for

After finishing every available episode of House, Bones, Fringe, and Prison Break, I found myself at a loss of what to watch. So as I was browsing for new TV Shows, I stumbled on this one and decided to give it a go.

I am very picky about TV series' but this one really captured me. After not expecting much, it really caught me by surprise how great this was.

It reminds me of Law & Order but with more drama and a following into the characters lives. It reminds me of "House" in many ways. It features a strict boss that will do anything to get the job done, and an employee willing to do anything for his boss.

It is certainly a new age show that will bring in audience from all ages from teenagers to seniors. I guarantee that you will not be disappointed with this show, as many new shows have disappointed me.

Turned out better than expected!
I'll first say that what made me keep coming back to finish the series was Louis Litt "Rick Hoffman" his character was so powerful, emotional and I loved to hate him and love him. Next I want to say that this show was made up of many great actors that would bring it home. Shout out to Gabriel Macht, Sarah Rafferty and the character Katrina played by Amanda Schull whose character development made me want to finish the series and not think twice after Megan left the series. Honestly, I thought the stories weaved together well as the writers and each actor did an excellent job. After finishing the series on Peacock I decided to come and rate the show. Not surprisingly this show doesn't need my high rating and everyone else already agrees that the show was well done.

Slow Scream
tinyone218 August 2017
I have watched all seasons.... unfortunately.

Originally the drama was tense and fun. The bromance between Harvey and Mike was also really interesting. However, over time the sparkle disappeared and the magic of Mike's amazing memory seems to have disappeared alongside it. Instead of being fun yet tense, the show has evolved into a continuous screaming match and people panicking about mundane nonsense. Made up drama that feels too forced to be entertaining.

Live. Die. Repeat.

Every episode seems like a catastrophe for the firm or the people. They resolve this by yelling at each other or trying to be really clever. Unfortunately the clever seems to have turned into everyday unspectacular. The characters are now just bumbling ants without direction and without any capacity for passionate relationships. Even Mike and Rachel or Harvey and Donna are washed out.

Worth a watch up to about season 3. Thereafter, it turns into a slow and agonizing death of a show.

Very good
dszabo-5313630 January 2023
"Suits" is a legal drama series that centers on a New York law firm and the talented yet unorthodox associate, Mike Ross, who becomes a lawyer without going to law school. The show's strengths lie in its witty dialogue, sharp writing, and dynamic performances from its cast, particularly Gabriel Macht as Harvey Specter and Patrick J. Adams as Mike Ross. The show's central themes of ambition, power, and redemption make for a captivating viewing experience, and the legal cases explored in each episode are both interesting and relevant to the larger story arcs. The show also has a strong sense of style, with its sharp suits and sleek office setting, which adds to its overall aesthetic appeal. However, some characters can feel one-dimensional, and some plot points can become predictable, which can detract from the overall excitement of the show. Nevertheless, "Suits" is a well-crafted and enjoyable legal drama that is definitely worth a watch for fans of the genre.

This is an example of TV show that producers don't know when to stop.
wino-8005021 August 2018
This TV series was really promising with good pilot, first and second season. And at some point it started turning more into soap lawyerish drama without this what it used to be. I would rate this TV show higher when it had been finished around season 4. It has it's own pattern that becomes annoying when you see it in every episode. But hey - you need to find it by yourself.

REPETATIVE SCRIPT
linda-plant221 April 2021
Clearly the scriptwriters didn't overwork themselves on this show. Every scene contained the word "Bullsh...t"; which alternated with "I'm Done" or "We're Done", then there was "I can fix this". Then the old chestnuts of "Dont lie to me " and "Tell me the truth".

The script in the last few seasons were so 'cheesy' it was excruciating to watch. Donna was just a promoted Secretary, but telling her employers what to do ???? In reality she would be shown the door, (and Harvey didn't have a secretary). Being a 'named' partner was the only goal of every character - it was laughable. And the actor playing Harvey, well he wouldn't win any Oscars for his love scenes - he even wore a T shirt in bed !!!! Perhaps because he real wife was a member of the cast he felt embarrassed, well I've seen wet lettuce with more passion.

Then the women were so thin, they could fall sideways down a drain ! The dresses were so tight you could see their organs. Highest of heels and empty handbags added to the hilarity. (why don't the Props people in films actually put something in handbags, even if its only a brick, to make it look realistic )

Not flawless, but well worth the journey
grahamf-555426 January 2021
I have just finished watching the whole show, from S1 to S9. Not quite a binge, but I put most other viewing aside. Like other reviewers, I felt that the the plot lost its way a bit somewhere around midway. But I don't see it as a serious lapse. It held my attention to the end, and I think it was the humour, as much as anything, that kept me going. As far as the comedy element goes, Rick Hoffman was outstanding. Delicious laugh out loud scenes that continued sporadically right through. The main flaws were some of the repetitive dialogue. At one point I was getting really annoyed that each episode contained at least one character asking another to look in the mirror. And there were many others. But I could easily forgive that, because the pace hardly ever dropped. The acting of all main characters was excellent. The flashbacks were well-handled and successfully explained how the key players behaved. I wondered whether to give an overall 7, but I think 8 is justified by the sheer scale of the show, and that the drama was maintained for so many episodes.

Good looking series
lamont-hard25 June 2011
After watching the pilot episode I was pleased from what I saw. The episode was long enough to give us a glimpse into some interesting characters. There seems to be a lot to go around with both leads social lives and how they impact the secondary characters. There Is no shortage of eye candy. I did find some of the time lines a bit of a stretch, but nothing major. I most enjoyed how the writers took the time to give good background material on just about the whole cast witch I think Is becoming so rare, knowing this info helps to get into these characters from the start. I recommend this show to viewers who like a lawyer type show with just a touch of softness.

As good as it gets when it comes to entertainment
matrixmistro10 December 2022
This series is as good at it gets and once you start you can't stop watching. One of my favourites out there in terms of acting, storyline and entertainment. I was hooked from the beginning. It did go down slightly for me from series 8 I guess. Something changed. Some actors left and some others brought in and I felt the dynamics of the show changed. I can't put my finger on it. Having said that I can't get enough of the show. The acting is superb. Everything about it is top notch.

Harvey is king. He is like the Gordon Gekko is the law world and is superb. I also like the fact the script emphases more than just winning cases and being ruthless. It does, but it's a lot more than that and often about doing the right thing and not just winning for the love of money but also taking risks, often bringing integrity, morals and principles to the equation. Often also a lot of sacrifices and risk. Mike Ross no doubt plays an essential role here and his friendship with Harvey is always entertaining to watch. The Batman and Robin team. Louis Litt is also one of my favourites in the show. A ruthless solicitor who is set on winning but he also brings a lot of humour and is a superb actor in this show. He balances out the tense moments and provides a nice balance and so does the character of Donna Paulsen. She reminds me of the pa/ secretary in Ally Mcbeal in many ways. Not sure if the writers based some of her on that like her ability to know all the gossip and listen in to all the conversations. It's very funny.

This has to be one of the best shows on Netflix at the moment. Prime as well. It's often hard for me to watch a series from start to finish. Mainly because it starts to lose some of its magic as the show goes on. Not this one. I did prefer some of the older shows but it is still a brilliant series from start to finish. Same that all good things in life have to come to an end. I wish there was more. Highly recommended.

This series has gradually become a hollow one
MovieIQTest20 September 2018
Update on 8/21/2019

There's no sense to go on. These characters leftover now only delivered hollow dialog to each other by verbally creating situations in those empty office buildings. This series should call quit when Mike and his wife seek new location to have a new life and lifestyle. It's already become a nuisance to watch this new season's every episode so far, so painful and annoying. Please call it off whenever you could. Have a new life...... ======================================================== Well, after some of the most important roles in this series left, the newest Suits S08 has become such a painful hollow slow cooker without any tasteful ingredients in it and kept deteriorating episode after episode. We can see so clearly that this series' budget has been cut and decreased hugely, so what we see in Season 8 is just a bunch of the familiar faces added another two walking around in an almost empty leased office space in business suits, yadayadayada like a bunch of old wives just delivering boring dialog to each other, or some boring internal fights over "whose name should be added on the wall" and nothing else. The office is almost as empty as a theater stage with some furnitures and several actors. Nothing worth seeing anymore, just like the Emperor's Clothe, under it, Nothing. It's time to wrap up and beg off.

The Good, the Bad and the Ugly
supergye31 December 2022
Warning: Spoilers
The series has a special magnetic vibe between the characters that draws me in. I had to upgrade my rating after getting through season 6. Just blew me out of the water! The riveting storyline was beyond any lawyer based storytelling. There is a lot of charisma especially with lead characters Harvey Specter and Mike Ross. Louis Litt provides the comedy relief as resident back stabber, snake in the grass. The intracompany fighting is humorous. After 4 seasons you will witness more drama between the employees, and or ex-employees than the outside cases that are tried. This seems a bit much at times. I don't know how long a firm would last with so much infighting going on! Then, there is the unbelievable loads of new evidence in cases discovered by the firm's leads that even Columbo would have had a hard time figuring out.

Mike Ross' character is roughly superhuman iq wise, like the android Data from Star Trek. I am sure there are people like him, but they are very few and far between. He is not only amazing with his photographic memory, but can sift through all that data superfast, a math genius, and comprehend all that info at the same time. Oh, did I tell you he is a great poker player like Harvey. Nearly everyone in the firm is near genius and most are attractive. Did I say all graduated at or near the top of their class? Oh, and Harvey was an amazing baseball player at Harvard, and majority partner Jessica Pearson was a great tennis player. Both very close to the pro level, you are supposed to believe. So, if the pure narcissism doesn't turn you off, you will then be amused by the inside joking and its dry sarcasstic demeanor.

The only reason I believe a guy like Mike Ross would be hired by Specter is due to the extreme narcissim of him and partners. The "I am always right" attitude is on display by the senior partners. This forces them into a corner and in a no-win situation against megamind Ross. In the real world it is my opinion, doubtful a large firm would risk losing their reputation with a guy who has no law degree, regardless of talent.

Rachel Zane played by Meghan Markle is surprisingly good as the office paralegal and girlfriend of Ross. Given all the bad press in real life, I will complement her acting talent.

If you want to play a game, have a drink everytime someone passes a paper or folder between characters. You won't last a whole episode. Actually don't try that, lol.

Characters Development
gkaris16 April 2023
Warning: Spoilers
The inception of the series is anchored on all PSL Lawyers being graduates of Harvard. When Louis Litt later on admits 'that not all great lawyers went to Harvard', the same serves an iconic line moving the ground beneath, and the viewers get to understand the purpose and impact of Mike Ross in the Series.

All the characters (including the new ones introduced in the middle of the series) go through a building process in their personal trajectories, articulated in their solo journeys, and ultimately ingrained into the team. The full circle moments are undeniably poetic and well-shown.

Amazing series.

Fading fast
t_ritz15 February 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I really liked the show for the first several seasons. Mike and Harvey made a great team that was fun to watch. Add in Donna and Louis and it was a really entertaining show. With Mike's trial they took a real turn to heavy drama. Then when Mike and Rachel leave the show, it goes downhill fast, and you can see why it's now canceled after a concluding season. There is no humor after Mike aside from occasionally Donna, and instead it is just one argument then backstab after another.

Excellent drama series
njmace30 July 2022
Anyone on here giving this a bad review is a angry person and would probably give The Godfather a 3 star rating

This show has good actors a good plot and enough suspense and drama to keep you entertained the whole way through

It is well worth the watch and even if it's not your cup of tea at first glance there is something in there for everyone

Also they don't shove political, woke, or PC values down your throat like all these other shows coming out lately they stick to the story and don't mold the story to fit a narrative they are trying to preach.

The good the bad and the whatever
londas26 July 2018
A really promising series....or the first few seasons, but then it felt like a merry-go-round that I wanted to get off. Too many similar scenarios and ridiculous outlines in trying and keep viewers going back for more. Are there any lawyers out there who´d like to give us a picture of what the real world of corporate law is like? Now they have introduced a so called actress. A Prima Donna of the screen who tries so hard to justify her pay with over-achievement to a point of grating ones teeth. Sorry, the writers should go back to the drawing board and give it a fresh coat of paint.

Very entertaining series, law firm in Manhattan.
TxMike18 January 2017
My wife and I came across this series on Amazon Prime streaming programming. We started watching it from episode 1 of season 1. Right now we are almost finished with season 2. Most episodes are about 42 minutes long, made for one hour time slot with commercials. We often watch 2 or 3 episodes a night.

The premise is set in the first episode, Harvey Specter is a great lawyer and senior partner in his firm. As he is fond of saying "I never lose." As he is looking to hire a new associate, interviewing one after another Harvard law graduate, Mike Ross suddenly and frantically appears at the interview venue. Mike Ross has no degree, he is a petty drug dealer, and takes the BAR exam for others for cash, he is a genius with a photographic memory but no degree. In spite of all that Harvey hires him.

Therefore an ongoing issue is who else will find out that Ross isn't really a lawyer? Specter and the firm obviously would get into lots of legal binds when or if it were found out.

As the characters flesh themselves out we meet Jessica Pearson who is the managing partner. We meet Louis Litt who is a brilliant lawyer but also a petty, deceiving chipmunk. He and Harvey are always at each other. Rachel Zane is the highly talented paralegal who desperately wants to pass the BAR and attend Harvard Law School. Donna Paulsen is the pretty and smart assistant to Harvey.

Season 1 has the best stories, as we are getting through season 2 we are losing a bit of interest but overall it is an entertaining diversion. We will probably keep watching.

FEB 2017 edit: We are now into season 4 and the show is still keeping our interest. We watch mainly for the characters and their interactions, the actual stories are secondary. Louis Litt is a great character.

MAR 2017 edit: We have completed season 4 and now are in season 5. My interest has been piqued again, a nightly ritual to watch 1 or 2 episodes when nothing else is on regular TV.

AUG 2017 edit: We just finished watching season 6 on DVDs from our public library, things changed quite a bit, not the least of which was Mike's stint in prison and Jessica's decision to follow her heart. After so many episodes the characters have become even more interesting.

AUG 2018 edit: We just finished watching season 7 on DVDs from our public library. While Jessica has moved on and now in Chicago she still turns up from time to time. Mostly a series of interesting storylines and Litt continues to entertain. Maybe this time next year we will be watching season 8.

Mike sucks
Zedyeti7 August 2020
This show first couple of seasons were great and interesting storyline but you soon find out how annoying mike is and every season he just gets worse and worse. Can't stand him and his constant whining. Other than that it's an alright show but misses too many opportunities to be great. Louis is actually a fun interesting character that's under utilized and really should have had more storylines with him and Harvey teaming up because it was new and fun. The layout was a mess that prevented this show from being known for more than just "the show that starred some actress marry a prince." In other words it's pretty forgettable. Louis should have got a spin-off... ok maybe not haha

The Best Version of this show include both Specter and Ross
cgordon3-112 October 2022
Warning: Spoilers
I'm watching this show after it's run, and I burned through Seasons 1-7 in typical binge fashion. Then I got to Season 8, and lost some steam. I read some reviews and skipped ahead to when Mike Ross came back in Season 9. The magic was back. I would say that this show probably should have treated Season 8 as it's last Season, and convinced Patrick Adams to move in and out like Jessica did when she left the show. Season 8 was a good season if you didn't know about the chemistry between Spector and Ross. To me that was the cornerstone of the show, and I say that even as I truly like all the other other actors.

Hard to swallow
dirtphelia3 March 2016
Warning: Spoilers
Edited to 1 star because it's just GARBAGE. Doesn't even deserve 1 star but it's the lowest rating allowed.

--- The show is entertaining up to the point that it questions the viewer's intelligence.

A legendary lawyer in what's probably the most competitive city in the world takes a chance on a drug-dealing pothead, who pretends to be a Harvard educated lawyer. OK, sure, what the hay.

Except the pothead, Mike, can't get his excrement together. He can't even *look* like a lawyer, which could be easily done by getting a decent suit and stopping riding that ridiculous bike. Sorry, but in New York City lawyers working at top firms don't ride bikes to work, especially not with messenger bags slung across their chests. He looks like a frat boy working as a bike messenger.

Then Mike starts messing up left and right. He has no sense of professionalism and his boss as well as the managing partner of the firm - seriously - keep putting their butts on the line for him. That simply would not happen. And every time Mike messes up big his superiors threaten to fire him but instead of firing him they keep giving him more chances and letting him handle/interfere in high profile cases.

Mike's unlikable and arrogant, and I just keep hoping he'll get hit by a truck and die. By the second season Mike, the pot smoker who used to get paid to cheat on college entrance exams for other people, the guy who kissed his best friend's girlfriend, the same one who sleeps with a married woman etc. etc., starts his right/wrong tirades, believing he's doing the right thing by betraying client privilege when he shares confidential information with the prosecution. And his top dog boss still doesn't fire the guy.

Like, no.

Who wrote this crap?
CineCritic251718 October 2013
Suits, an obvious emergence in television set around two super-brained lawyers who get away with the stunts they pull only because the script allows it. The writing of this crap is so unbelievably juvenile and ushered in, I'm really surprised anyone can watch more than 4 episodes of this.

Every episode is an exact copy of the previous one, with different client names and situations. Every slick rebuke that is uttered by either one of the main characters is so unbelievably set up, they might have read them off a menu.

Everything about this series feels fake and concocted. The high score this series gets from its audience either gives testament to the lousy offerings at this moment or the lack of taste of the general public.

Disappointing season 5
silmarieni12 April 2016
Warning: spoilers.

Overall, season 5 was a letdown. The second half with Mike Ross' will he-won't he I would rate with 1. It only proves that you can have photographic memory and be a retard.

Someone as intelligent as Ross is supposed to be would know his only chance was to fight till the end. Or, as he already did in another season stop working as a lawyer and do something else such as finance.

There is absolutely no logic in not waiting for the verdict and taking a guilty plea at the last moment. He had to know the consequences is all the procedures he touched would be tainted and opened to lawsuits, destroying the firm and its partners .

THe hundreds of back and force in the last episodes are as tiring for the viewers as they are illogical and senseless.

As senseless as letting down everybody 5 minutes before the wedding after having spent days lobbying everybody into attending.

Frankly, this makes Ross more antipathetic than ever, and I couldn't care less what happens next.

I'll try to keep the fond memories of season 1 instead.

I liked season 1-3. Not your typical chain smoking, show.

Season 4+ does what all the other TV shows do, it turns from a court drama to a daytime melodrama.

I rate S1-3 with a solid 7 and S4+ as a solid -1.

The whole S4+ show is arguing, bickering and childish manipulating. They spend 2-5 minutes on actual courtroom a$$ kicking.

Hardly watchable to fans who enjoyed the intelligence and wit of Season One.
Mr_Blond2315 August 2013
Warning: Spoilers
I watch a fair amount of TV and think that I have fairly selective tastes in shows, but Suits was one of my favorite recently produced shows. The first season was bold, smart, and very polished. This is one show that definitely deserves HD. Harvey Specter was by far one of the best fictional lawyers out there. One of the best parts of the show was the focus on the "case of the week" idea, and all the clever dialog and intricate legal drama that came with it. The third episode with the boardroom battle over control of the car company was a kind of 'everyday-epic.' Another highlight was the inclusion of three very smart female characters: Donna, Rachel, and Jessica. Most notably, the primary characters had a powerful and flawless way about them that justified their "it's not about caring its about winning" attitude.

Sadly, the subsequent seasons have quickly degenerated. The smart female characters were transformed into gossipy shrews who now appear on screen just to spark inter-office drama and occasionally look good. Gone is the intricate legal maneuvering (ie crown jewel defense), replaced only with on-screen commentary on supposedly brilliant off-screen meetings or court appearances we never get to see. The witty banter has been dulled by a sheer lack of originality, such that the characters seemingly make the exact same jokes, only with different pop culture references. Worst of all, the writers (who must be high off the first season's success or the weed they purchased with the money from it) have turned all the powerful characters (Harvey, Jessica... etc) into flawed shells of former characters hardly fit for big firm life. This done of course to pander to the "average viewer" who tunes in to follow the lawyer version of days of our lives with pretty girls lusting after handsome men. Based on the level infighting in the firm, its a wonder how they log any billable hours at all. The only saving grace of Season 2 was Louis Litt's mostly solid character development.

The end of the second season allowed the show to reach a new low by introducing a British takeover of the firm with a host of odd new British characters (ie Louis's big eared British counterpart) thrust into the show just for simplistic comical value, which I'm sure a select group of slack-jawed simple viewers might thoroughly enjoy.

I write this review in the hope that some executive, writer or actor on the show might happen upon it, realize that their show is rapidly in decline and right the ship before even loyal viewers like myself simply tune out all together. The show achieved a lot in Season 1, but much of the acclaim was lost by way of lazy writing and lack of imagination.

Lastly, its a law show, you'd think they would cover the legal side a bit more than as a basis for Donna to bang a Brit or Rachel's dad to meet Mike.

UPDATE: This show has devolved to nothing more that a nicely filmed soap opera that has little connection to legal reality nor to intelligent discourse of any kind. I just removed it from my DVR.

Suits is brilliant
michael-mcgee-969-35731913 February 2013
Suits is a compelling legal drama set in the heart of New York City at one of the city's most successful law firms. The story is centred around the firm's best lawyer, Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht), an egotistical, uncompassionate, charmingly witty Harvard graduate who will do whatever it takes to win – "The best closer this city has ever seen"; and his associate Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams), an under-achieving compassionate genius with an eidetic memory who strikes lucky by having the opportunity to work at one of the highest profile legal firms even after being caught for attempted drug trafficking and without the required qualifications. The show follows both characters as they face different legal and personal challenges in each episode whilst maintaining the gregarious and quick-witted rapport between the two.

The show offers plenty of variety besides the law by developing the relationships of many characters inside the firm, "Pearson Hardman", managed by Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres), a career-minded powerful woman. Jessica must balance between her two best lawyers, a devious Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman) and Harvey, whose relationship is filled with rivalry and playable banter, is certainly one to make you laugh. The show also follows the stories of the beautiful Rachel (Meghan Markel), a paralegal whose test anxieties are stopping her from fulfilling her ambitions of going to Harvard to study law and Donna (Sarah Rafferty) a smart, sexy secretary.

Besides the two leading characters, Suits is balanced excellently with an ensemble cast filled with intriguing relationships and an original and sharp script combined with the beautiful backdrop of New York City to make this a thoroughly enjoyable TV show which I can't help but grin ear-to-ear from start to finish and I hope it continues its high standards for seasons to come. Suits is brilliant.

Great show for seven seasons
sweber3303-590-8158669 August 2022
Was a complete show, for 7 seasons. But Meghan Markle suddenly became the Yoko to Suits.

With Meghan Markles exit, the show lost one of its stars. And season 8-9 became just a swan song.

From a decent start to a downward spiral. There is simply no way this show is an 8.8!
mlynch51879 June 2015
Although it had an 8.8 rating on IMDb, I was very skeptical of Suits at first. It looked like one of those shows where everyone is young, good looking, successful, and full of witty comebacks. You know, one of those shows that look kind of like, well, every other show out there. Admittedly it was with a bit of surprise that I found myself enjoying the first season. It wasn't a masterpiece, but it was certainly an enjoyable show. I expected that after the solid first season that the show would only improve.

Instead, Suits fell into a downward spiral. Season 2 continued to play on season one's successes but also took it's first steps towards becoming that "just another contrived show full of good looking people making witty comebacks" show. By season 3 logic seemed to go out the window as the show turned cheesy and downgraded central characters to buffoonery. The show was becoming something of a soap opera. The show came to revolve around who said what to who when, how they said it, and who is lying to who. Characters became stuck in one dimension. Plots seemed to repeat only with new characters (all young, good looking and unbelievably successful, of course).

Cue season 4. In season 4 the downward spiral fell to new depths. The show no longer seems to be about the trials and tribulations of Mike Ross, but almost entirely about sappy romances, office gossip, and petty grudges. To be more blunt, the show has declined into a preteen drama. If you are a clingy 14-year old girl who wants to gossip to your friends about what Donna heard Rachel say to Mike about Harvey it might be intriguing (no offense to all the 14-year old girls out there) but compared to what the show used to be, it is a disaster. I find myself skipping entire scenes because they are simply annoying. What may be even sadder is that I spend a good chunk of the other scenes on my phone looking up things on Google. I just don't care how about who is lying to who or about how long characters can keep their relationship a secret at work. It's lame, and it isn't what made Suits a good show when it started.

All in all, there is no way that this show (all seasons accounted for) deserves an 8.8. Not even close. Really, watch other 8.8 shows like Boardwalk Empire, The Shield, Six Feet Under, Homeland and Dexter and then tell me that this show should be rated anywhere near them. Season 1 may have been an 8 (or so) but honestly by season 4 the show has declined to a 3 or a 4.

No substance
Oneillmike12 April 2013
I have watched all the episodes and became increasingly disenchanted with the show. Too much melodrama, not enough substance. I am a person who loves legal dramas, anything with convincing courtroom scenes. The initial premise of an unqualified lawyer with a photographic memory was interesting but this plot was quickly relegated to the back burner. Instead each show became more typically an average soap opera where the main characters were routinely thrown into conflict with each other and starting keeping secrets and telling lies to each other. This is the staple diet of any soap you care to watch and the easiest way to create tension and drama. The love affair between Rachel and Mike was juvenile and it got to the point where I would fast forward when Rachel came into view - all she did was to complain about Mike and life in general. Finally I have to say that at the end of season 2 I lost any interest in Harvey, he seemed selfish and isolated and I could not understand his position at all. He was fighting everyone and for what reason ?

one lawyer , one genius equals trouble .
mendelman-jacobson24 June 2011
when i first heard about this TV series i thought why bother its probably stupid ! how good could it be ? but then i thought you know ill watch the pilot and give it a shot , why not ? before i knew it my eyes were glued to the screen from beginning to end and i enjoyed it to the fullest . this show in a way reminds me of "house MD " a TV series with a lot of knowledge and brains and in the future will show many law cases which will be won by these guys , a top of the line lawyer named Harvey and a genius without a degree named mike who when hears anything or reads anything remembers it forever . and i strongly recommend this TV series to anybody who likes to enjoy themselves because trust me this TV series ain't boring !

Goodbye. Perfect
michael-539-51705417 December 2020
Always used IMDB for as long as I can remember and never left a review and for some reason I feel like I have to for suits.

Just watched the final episode and I don't know why but it's reminded me of the last ten years of my life, the ups and downs and everything important I've ever been through with the people I love and have loved.

The last episode brings everything together and is the perfect ending, and I have to say suits is one if not the best series I've watched. Perfection, and that's not a word I use often.

The show has a slow but fun start initially and you grow to love so many characters, it shows the importance of friends of family and that sometimes life isn't always perfect but you should always be strong, persistent, kind and forgiving.

After a number of people come and go it still continues to get better and better all the way to the end.

Thank you to the show.

End it now, it would be a mercy killing.
eddie-earl-99-52167524 January 2019
Warning: Spoilers
I see that there is going to be a ninth season, why?

It was on it's knees in season 7, the only believable character was Mike Ross, his departure should have indicated to the production team that it's time was up.

I just watched season 8 episode 11 and it was so bland that I have forgotten it already.

A refreshing dose of smarts and laughs
xoxfallen-angelxox7 July 2011
It has been a while since I have discovered a series I truly enjoy watching. Some are way too stupid and then others are way too boring, and then some have horrible actors and the list goes on.

However, in this little gem, everything is exactly right. The script matches funny and serious, silly and smart, everything at exactly the right amounts. The actors act well. Watching this show is a generally enjoyable experience which, I think, is a lot when it comes to some recent series.

I would recommend this to anyone who likes 'House MD', 'How I Met Your Mother' and other series that are often watched to feel better after a long day.

Good looking cliché's bore me to death
eddy14722 October 2013
Suits is about a lawyer Harvey Specter, the best closer in New York who gets an apprentice, Mike Ross, a kid so intelligent who remembers not only everything, but also seems to understand everything.

So far so good.

But that's where the interesting part ends. The rest of the whole show is about cocky, faceless robots who want to be the the biggest smart-ass in the room. Even that is not so bad, but the quality of the dialogs are of a 14 year old.

The show lacks humor. Of an adult that is. The show misses also excitement, because really everything is predictable. Every episode is almost the same, just the topic is slightly different, and different clients.

Don't see it. I did, but found myself staring at my phone or the newspaper most of the time. "I am missing something. It has an 8.8. That's higher than Boardwalk Empire. Which is a good series." But no I wasn't missing something. It's bad.

Suits is dead
horrorfaninusa3 January 2019
Warning: Spoilers
The foundation of Suits was the friendship between Mike and Harvey. Once Mike is gone, the show lost its spirit. Suits was all about how friends stand for each other, sacrifice everything if they have to along the way regardless of the consequences.

Mike's pro bono cases would warm our hearts and make us remember that not everything is about money and we would side with Mike while he beat the bad guys to get justice for the poor and in need.

Rachel would make Mike remember about ethics and moral code to keep Mike in check. Their relationship would melt our hearts and cause us envy about what they have together as a couple.

I understand that Meghan (Rachel) became a member of Royal family therefore had to quit acting, but the producers should have found a way to keep Mike.

With Mike and Rachel gone, Donna's stupid "I am the smartest" parade became really boring and quite annoying. I'm kind of tired seeing her stupid face every other scene and her sticking her illiterate nose into everything was one of the pet peeves that made me lose interest in this show.

It was cool in the beginning to have a character like Donna that knows someone like Harvey inside out, but once she became know it all it made the character ridiculous and not believable.

Louis does a great job in acting and his comedic performance with Sheila and doctor Lipschtick is the only glue that's holding this show together.

Samanta is a one dimensional cookie cutter character and Kathrene Heigl is definitely a wrong cast. I burst into tears every time I see her 50 pounds head with fully botoxed face walking around like a sheman mimicless.

Show runners should definitely tone down Donna and bring more interesting characters in if they want to save this show. Otherwise, with uninteresting characters like Samanta and Alex, this show will most likely be canceled end of season 8.

great cast and great characters
SnoopyStyle26 September 2019
Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is a brilliant mind who often ends up in the murkier part of the law to make ends meet. He gets paid for taking the bar exam for other people. He delivers a case of weed for his drug dealing best friend. He avoids the police and ends up in a job interview with lawyer Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). As the ace closer of his firm, Harvey often use his instincts to skirt the law and in this case, he decides to hire the law school dropout without a law licence. It's a big deal since it's fraud and the firm only hires Harvard grads. Harvey has his plugged-in secretary Donna Paulsen (Sarah Rafferty), rival litigator Louis Litt (Rick Hoffman), and mentor Jessica Pearson (Gina Torres). Mike falls at first sight for beautiful paralegal Rachel Zane (Meghan Markle).

This is mostly fun although nine seasons is too long by half. It's over-wrought to the point that the constant yelling becomes a part of the motif of the show. Another part of the motif must be the Toronto for New York non-descript business buildings. As often is the case, the best has to be the cast of characters and the actors inhabiting those roles. It's a great group of actors including a future princess. It's fun to hang out with them in their suits.

Suits(2011-2019)- Review
CouchReview29 December 2020
Suits is a legal drama, primarily showcasing a law firm (initially Pearson Hardman), its workings and the stories few of few of its executives. It would have been a very much alike to the ubiquitous TV shows' on lawyers/law firms, but Suits brings together a curl to the high flying lifestyle of lawyers, or as has been showcased on the screen. Mike Ross (Patrick J. Adams) is nothing short of a genius with his brilliant mind and photographic memory, but due to his unimpressive history in his previous years has stymied him in achieving his dream from becoming a lawyer. To make ends meet he takes on a few jobs whose legality can be questioned. When one of these jobs takes a dark turn, and Mike trying to fend off the police of his shoulder, serendipitously runs into Harvey Specter (Gabriel Macht). Harvey is interviewing candidates for his firm. Harvey extremely impressed by Mike offers him the job despite knowing that he does not have a law degree. The basic premise of the story works on this with Mike & Harvey trying to keep Mike's identity a secret, along with taking on difficult cases and trying to find solutions in unconventional ways. Creator & writer Aaron Korsh doesn't disappoint much throughout the series, with well thought of stories & scenarios. Gabriel Macht does an amazing job portraying an uptown playboy-esque New York lawyer. Patrick J. Adams too does a good enough job, but sometimes does not meet the high standards set by Macht. Other members of the main cast should also be appreciated for their efforts, particularly Sarah Rafferty as Donna Paulsen & Rick Hoffman as Louis Litt. The music and background score is satisfying and gives a bit of excitement which works in the series' advantage when some episodes' story is not good enough. Direction & Cinematography too does not fetch too many complaints. The series runs for 9 seasons and by the end feels stretched out lacking much depth. It would have been better if they would have taken the Breaking Bad route of limiting the seasons. Initially the cast remains standard across seasons with a few additions here and there, but by the end it's a jumbled up cast with a few original members and additions, who too are changed time and again, which is not always received well by the viewers. Story-wise it is plausible and remains to the point, but by the end it lacks quality, as it is being tried to be overextended. For a legal series if a few more storylines/scenes would have been based in the courtroom like Boston Legal it could have been better. It kicks off with a bang but by the end loses its touch, but it is surely entertaining throughout even with its flaws. If you choose to see only the first 7 seasons, it would not be the worst idea. It can be boring for people who are not much interested in business/corporates type of genres, but if you are into it it's a must watch. Acting- 8.5 Casting- 8.5 Cinematography- 9 Dialogue- 8 Directing- 8.5 Editing & Effects- 7.5 Sound & Music- 9 Story- 8 Storytelling- 8.5 Rating- 8.5

Stupid program trying to be intellectually clever but failing as the writers themselves aren't at that level.
kikkapi2017 January 2015
My friend just put it on... I couldn't see it from where I was standing but on hearing some rock song playing while some opening bedroom action was about to happen, made me think, "contrived mindless lyrics over the top of some tired riff regurgitated trying to be hip". But the reality is that this program is dismissed by those occupying that rare level of intellect, who are socially ahead of the general rabble, aloof as required but still able to communicate with others if required. The conceited attempt of all that this program tries to conjure up fails. Why? Because the writers cant create the correct ambiance, atmosphere,subtleties, nuances and everything else that goes into making the very very limited great shows there have been (like BB). Why can't the writers of Suit do this? Well it's because they are just like that unsophisticated rabble that rave about it. Statistically if you want: Not the bottom 25% of the populace. It's the lower/middle/middle- upper group making up the bulk of mindless Suit lovers. Then after that there's the upper (where these stupid writers and creators think they inhabit). Because being at that level, they will never be enlightened there is another movement above that. That is the top most 5% -that group I alluded to above. Yes I know what you the reader is thinking... what implausible rubbish. But you would. You resemble those who dismissed for 150 years of there being another very secret calculation to quantum probability that theory amplitudes well beyond the sub atomic level now bringing finality to life as it is now, exposing further origin revelations and later what will happen -all of a sudden. In all the billions of universes. All at the same time. Now, in the future and simultaneously in the PAST.
